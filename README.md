# Data Clumps Doctor

![Demo](https://github.com/NilsBaumgartner1994/DataClumpsDoctor/blob/master/docs/generalIdea.png?raw=true)

In development :-)

## Description

This is a tool to help you find data clumps in your code. It is based on the [Data Clumps](https://refactoring.guru/smells/data-clumps) refactoring smell.
It will find all data clumps in your repository and creates a pull request for each data clump. The pull request contains a diff of the data clump and a suggestion for a refactoring.
